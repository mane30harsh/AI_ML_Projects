# LinkChatter - Chat with Websites

## Overview
LinkChatter is a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab) project that allows users to interact with website content using AI-powered question-answering. The notebook utilizes LangChain for processing web pages and answering queries based on the extracted content.

## Features
- Extracts content from a given web URL
- Uses LangChain for efficient document processing
- Provides AI-powered question-answering capabilities
- Runs on Google Colab with GPU acceleration

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8+
- LangChain
- Streamlit (if using a GUI interface)
- FAISS (for efficient search indexing)
- Hugging Face models (for embeddings and QA)

## Installation & Setup
To run the notebook on Google Colab:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install required dependencies using the following command:
   ```python
   !pip install -U langchain-community
   ```
3. Run the cells in order to process website content and ask questions interactively.

## Usage
1. Enter a website URL when prompted.
2. The script will fetch and process the content.
3. Ask questions about the website content, and the AI will provide relevant answers.
