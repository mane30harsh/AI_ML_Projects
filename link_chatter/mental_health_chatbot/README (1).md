# 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot

This project is a Mental Health Chatbot designed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It provides basic conversational support for mental health and emotional well-being. The chatbot is intended to simulate empathetic responses, helping users feel heard and supported.

## 📌 Features

- Provides responses based on user input using a rule-based and retrieval-based approach.
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to determine the most appropriate response.
- Includes basic preprocessing like lemmatization and tokenization for better performance.
- Runs entirely within a Jupyter Notebook (no external APIs required).
- Offers a simple and accessible mental health support experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
- NumPy
- Pandas

## 📁 Files

- `Mental_Health_Chatbot.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the full code for the chatbot, including data preprocessing, vectorization, and interactive chat interface.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas
```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.
4. Interact with the chatbot by entering your messages in the input cell.

## 💡 Example Interaction

```
You: I'm feeling very anxious today.
Bot: I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You're not alone, and it might help to talk to someone you trust or a professional.
